*Master 1*

**Development Measurement**

The aim of this course is to shed critical light on the indicators used to measure development. This course is structured around two central questions:

1. How the main development indicators are constructed, what information they provide and what their limitations are?

2. How to address data sources and the complexity of measurement in developing countries?

**Econometrics**

This course deepens the basics of econometrics, providing students with a solid understanding of the estimation and modelling techniques essential for analysing economic problems related to development. The following topics will be covered: 

1. The classical regression model

2. Properties of the OLS estimator in large samples

3. Heteroscedasticity: The problem and correction methods

4. Non-linear models: Probit and Logit

5. Count models: Poisson models

[**Climate and Data**](https://jeanbaptisteguiffard.github.io/courses_climatedata.html)
--->

To become familiar with climate issues and to understand the construction of sustainable development indicators, this course proposes: 

1. Intensive training in R software 

2. Advanced skills in data collection, processing, and analysis on R (graphical representations, maps, data extractions, web scraping, textual analysis. . . )

3. A common theme: climate data and sustainable development indicators.
